# Illuminations

## Illuminations types

**Fireflies** are small flying insects that come out during the night and disappear when the sun rises. They will appear in small quantities in jungle, plains, savanna and taiga type biomes, medium quantities in forest and river type biomes and great quantity in swamp type biomes.![illuminations-1.0-fireflies](README.assets/illuminations-1.0-fireflies.png)

### Plankton

Glowing **plankton** - even though difficult to notice because of its size - can be found floating around in the dark parts of the oceanic depths. They appear in any ocean biome as long as the light is sufficiently low.

## Auras

**Auras** are special Illuminations effects around the player visible to other players that have the mod. Auras currently serve as a bonus for donators that support the mod and are purely cosmetic with no other provided advantage whatsoever. They are visible to other players with Illuminations installed (even on vanilla servers).

### Twilight aura

The **Twilight** aura creates magenta colored fireflies that will orbit around the player. If the player moves, they will leave a trail of these fireflies.
