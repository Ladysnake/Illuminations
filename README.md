# Illuminations

**Illuminations** is a client sided Minecraft Fabric mod that adds multiple ambient particles in order to make your world more enjoyable at night or in dark places.

## Illuminations types

### Fireflies

**Fireflies** are small flying insects that come out during the night and disappear when the sun rises. They will appear in small quantities in jungle, plains, savanna and taiga type biomes, medium quantities in forest and river type biomes and great quantity in swamp type biomes.

### Chorus Petals

Appearing near Chorus flowers, these beautiful petals will twirl down to the ground, to the winds of the End, transitioning from a beautiful white to a majestic purple. The younger the flower is, the more petals will appear, and breaking a Chorus flower will provoke a burst of petals (again, the younger the flower, the more petals will burst).

### Glowworms

**Glowworms** are small larvae living in caves by sticking to the ceiling that will fall down if their support block is removed. They will appear in small quantities in jungle, plains, savanna and taiga type biomes, medium quantities in forest and river type biomes and great quantity in swamp type biomes.

### Plankton

Glowing **plankton** - even though difficult to notice because of its size - can be found floating around in the dark parts of the oceanic depths. They appear in any ocean biome as long as the light is sufficiently low.

### "Autumnflies"

During the month of October, fireflies will adopt an orange tint instead of their regular green one.

### Eyes in the Dark

Also during the month of October, you may come across glowing eyes in absolutely dark spots. These eyes will disappear if you come too close or if their darkness is disturbed by a light source.

## Configurability

Illuminations possesses a few config options you can use to change how the mod behaves to better fit your needs.

### Eyes in the Dark

Enable glowing eyes appearing in low light environments. Set on ENABLE by default.
- ENABLE: Eyes will appear during October
- DISABLE: Eyes will never appear
- ALWAYS: Eyes will appear no matter the date

### Spawn Density

The spawn rate percentage multiplier. Does not affect eyes in the dark.
0% Disables illuminations, 1000% Multiplies the amount of illuminations appearing by 10.

## Cosmetics

**Auras** are special Illuminations effects around the player visible to other players that have the mod. Auras currently serve as a bonus for donators that support the mod and are purely cosmetic with no other provided advantage whatsoever. They are visible to other players with Illuminations installed (even on vanilla servers).

**Overheads** are cosmetics that float above player heads. They are visible to other players with Illuminations installed (even on vanilla servers).

Auras and overheads can be selected and changed via the [Illuminations dashboard](https://illuminations.uuid.gg/).

### Twilight aura

The **Twilight** aura creates colored fireflies  that will orbit around the player. The color of the fireflies can be changed to any color you want via the Illuminations dashboard. If the player moves, they will leave a trail of these fireflies. This aura is available to tier 1 donators.

### Ghostly aura

The **Ghostly** aura emanates little ghosts that fly upward and gradually appear and disappear. This aura is available to tier 2 donators.
